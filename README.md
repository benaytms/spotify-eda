# spotify-eda

This project consists of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Spotify dataset from Kaggle.

## Overview

First, i cleaned up the data, made some adjustments where i thought was needed and then at the end i made some assessments using the prepared data.

This notebook is nowhere near a professional notebook, this is purely for study and applied practices. I wanted to document what exactly is it that i do on a EDA usually, so that's what is most focused on, explaining my thought process and methods used.
